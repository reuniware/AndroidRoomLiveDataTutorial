# AndroidRoomLiveDataTutorial
Basic Kotlin code for accessing a SQL Lite database on Android (create db, insert data, read data, delete data close db). I will try to add LiveData tests later.

For now there is only the code to create a SQL lite database, create a table, insert data, delete data, and close table.

Later (maybe) I'll try to add some LiveData features...
